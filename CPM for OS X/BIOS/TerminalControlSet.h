	These are the currently defined attributes. The attribute values you'll get back per
	character are 16-bit quantities since it'll likely become necessary to store 4-bit colours
	in there too for some terminal emulations; effectively I'm asserting that 16 bits is
	enough to store the union of all character attributes for all terminals â€” the internal
	attribute layout is fixed, it's not per terminal.
