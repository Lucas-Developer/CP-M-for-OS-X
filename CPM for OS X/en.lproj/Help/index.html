		<h1>CP/M for OS X</h1>

		<p>
			CP/M for OS X is a reimplementation of CP/M-80 for OS X, allowing
			CP/M transient programs (ie, applications) to run on modern computers.
		</p><p>
			CP/M for OS X does not attempt to reimplement the command control processor
			and does not provide any other sort of command-line interface.
		</p>
		<h2>Launching CP/M Software</h2>
		<p>
			To launch a CP/M program, locate its .COM in the Finder and double click.
		</p>
		<h2>Loading Documents from Other Directories</h2>
		<p>
			When it launches an application, CP/M for OS X will create a virtual A:
			drive that maps to that application's directory. The application will then
			be launched from the A: drive.
		</p><p>
			To give the application access to a file outside of its own directory, drag
			and drop the file onto the application's window. CP/M for OS X will ensure
			that it has a virtual drive mapped for that file's folder and then type
			the drive letter and filename into the virtual machine.
