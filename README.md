CP/M for OS X
=============

A z80 emulator + CP/M-80 reimplementation that intends to allow original CP/M software to be used under OS X.

This project focuses on ease of use and to that end does not reimplement the console command processor â€” there is
no command line. CP/M applications are opened directly from the Finder and input and output to them is handled
intuitively by drag and drop.
